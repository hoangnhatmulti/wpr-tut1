    <p>A markup language combines text as well as coded instructions on how to format that text. Nowadays, if you mention the term markup to any knowledgeable web author, the first thing they are likely to think of is HTML. So from whence came the stuff that web pages are made of?</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size:24px;">In the Beginning</h2>
    
    <p>HTML — which is short for HyperText Markup Language — is the official language of the World Wide Web and was first conceived in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee:</p>
    
    <blockquote> HTML is a product of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) which is a complex, technical specification describing markup languages, especially those used in electronic document exchange, document management, and document publishing.</blockquote>
    
    <p>HTML was originally created to allow those who were not specialized in SGML to publish and exchange scientific and other technical documents. HTML especially facilitated this exchange by incorporating the ability to link documents electronically using "hyperlinks". Thus the name Hypertext Markup Language. However, it was quickly realized by those outside of the discipline of scientific documentation that HTML was relatively easy to learn, was self contained and lent itself to a number of other applications. </p>
    <blockquote>With the evolution of the World Wide Web, HTML began to proliferate and quickly spilled over into the mainstream.</blockquote>
