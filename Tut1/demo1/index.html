    <h1 style="font-size:30px;">The history of HTML</h1>

    <p>A markup language combines text as well as coded instructions on how to format that text. Nowadays, if you mention the term markup to any knowledgeable web author, the first thing they are likely to think of is HTML. So from whence came the stuff that web pages are made of?</p>
    
    <h2 style="font-size:24px;">In the Beginning</h2>
    
    <p>HTML — which is short for HyperText Markup Language — is the official language of the World Wide Web and was first conceived in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee:</p>
    
    <blockquote> HTML is a product of SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) which is a complex, technical specification describing markup languages, especially those used in electronic document exchange, document management, and document publishing.</blockquote>
    
    <p>HTML was originally created to allow those who were not specialized in SGML to publish and exchange scientific and other technical documents. 
    <br>HTML especially facilitated this exchange by incorporating the ability to link documents electronically using "hyperlinks". Thus the name Hypertext Markup Language. 
    <br>However, it was quickly realized by those outside of the discipline of scientific documentation that HTML was relatively easy to learn, was self contained and lent itself to a number of other applications. </p>
    <blockquote>With the evolution of the World Wide Web, HTML began to proliferate and quickly spilled over into the mainstream.</blockquote> 
    
    <h3 style="font-size:22px;">Browser Wan</h2>
    
    <p>Soon, companies began creating browsers — the software required to view an HTML document, i.e., a web page — and as they gained popularity it gave rise to competition and other web browsers.
    <br>It may surprise some that back in late 1995, Netscape — which now plays a distant second to the King Kong of browsers, Internet Explorer — was the dominant browser on the market. In fact, Netscape was the first browser to support Javascript, animated gifs and HTML frames.
    <blockquote>Thus began the so-called "browser wars" and, along with seeing who could implement more bells and whistles than the other guy, browser makers also began inventing proprietary HTML elements that only worked with their browsers. Some examples of these are the cmarquee>...</marquee> tags (scrolling text) which originally only worked with Internet Explorer and the <blink>...</blink> tags (blinking text) which still only works with Gecko-based browsers such as Firefox. </blockquote>
    
    <h4 style="font-size:22px;">Bad Grammar</h2>
    
    <p>As the World Wide Web approached adulthood hosting a wide variety of would-be and professional web page authors, it became increasingly apparent that cyberspace was filling up with a lot of badly written HTML.<br> 
    <br>This was due to some laziness and inexperience but was also the product of another instant solution involving web authoring tools, most particularly WYSIWYG editors which tended to produce bloated and messy source code.
    <blockquote>Hence the birth of the next generation of HTML called XHTML, the 'X 'representing that this version of HTML was based on XML (eXtensible Markup Language) instead of SGML</blockquote>
    
    <h5 style="font-size:24px;">HTML</h5>
    
    <p>Since 2004, the development of HTML is closed by W3C when it decides to instead focus on XHTML. WHATWG is formed to develop HTML further, with the aim of reflecting the modern dynamic web, while keeping backwards compatibility with existing HTML code.
    <br>From 2004 to 2007, WHATWG gains support from major web browser developers.
    <br>In 2006, W3C also announces its support for the project.
    <br>In 2008, the first public draft of HTML5 is released by WHATWG.
    <br>From 2012, W3C and WHATWG decide to separate development of HTML5. W3C would work on a definitive standard of HTML5, while WHATWG would pursue development of a "living standard" – a continual evolution with ongoing improvements.
    <br>In 2014, W3C releases its official HTML5 recommendation.
